# Plan for 2026

Add new endpoints to start generators for ADetailer and HighRes(+ upscale). These generators will be different from the current one because I don't want to complicate things.
What I want is to start txt2img generators that will be ready to accept prompts requests and create images.
Then later on start another generator for img2img to upscale/highres/fix that will be ready to accept images with prompts for processing.
